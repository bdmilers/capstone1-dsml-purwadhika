# Sabang ERP: Divisional Integration for Progressive Business
Companies often have difficulty integrating the functions of each division, so many problems occur. In this case, a system is needed to encourage automation and work integration between divisions. I tried to design the system using the Python programming language by integrating 4 main divisions in a retail company, namely Sales, Warehouse, Finance and Purchasing. As a result, a Sabang ERP system was created that was able to record the work processes of each division and directly automate them to other divisions, thus supporting strong collaboration to support company performance.
